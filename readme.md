## TODO

### MVP

- [ ] Create Apps
- [ ] Assign Domains to the apps

- TBD

Use it with something like portainer to manage domain and apps using docker, possibly also add in watchtower and a local docker registry to run a self-hosted system.

## Future

Get rid of the dependency on watch tower and portainer to keep the whole solution light
