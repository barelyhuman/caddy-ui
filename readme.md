## TODO

### MVP

- [x] Apps
  - [x] Delete
  - [x] Map Domain
  - [x] Map Ports
- [ ] Sync Settings with Caddy

### Roadmap

- TBD

## Requirement

Use it with something like portainer to manage domain and apps using docker, possibly also add in watchtower and a local docker registry to run a self-hosted system.

## Future

Get rid of the dependency on watch tower and portainer to keep the whole solution light
